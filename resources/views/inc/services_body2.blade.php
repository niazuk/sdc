				<h3>Maintain control</h3>
				<p>We know how important it is for you to keep a good relationship with your clients. Getting the money you are owed shouldnâ€™t rid you of a customer, so we act on behalf of you to give them a friendly reminder of their outstanding invoices. You get a professional service with a high level of success, and your client has an open line of communication to resolve any queries.</p>

				<h3>Flat fee and same-day service</h3>
				<p>We charge a flat monthly fee for our credit control services, as opposed to charging commission. This allows  you control how much you spend based on the number of invoices to be collected. We provide same day service so you know exactly where your accounts are up to, keeping your accounting systems accurate.</p>
